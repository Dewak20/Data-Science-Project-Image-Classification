# Data-Science-Project-Image-Classification
This project shows how to classify a collection of pictures of people using masks correctly, incorrectly and not wearing masks. It creates an image classifier using a tf.keras.preprocessing.image. The purpose of this project is to create a model that can classify images whether the person in the image is wearing a mask correctly, incorrectly or not using a mask.
# This tutorial follows a basic machine learning workflow:
- Examine and understand data
- Build an input pipeline
- Build the model
- Train the model
- Test the model
- Improve the model and repeat the process
